# CoreChat - Product Overview
## Your AI Chat App for iPhone 17

### What We're Building
A sleek, native iOS chat app that runs AI models directly on your iPhone 17 using Core ML. No internet required once models are downloaded - everything happens on-device using Apple's Neural Engine.

### Why This Project?
- **Learn Core ML:** Hands-on experience with Apple's machine learning framework
- **iPhone 17 Optimization:** Take advantage of the latest Neural Engine capabilities
- **Privacy First:** All conversations stay on your device
- **Real Development:** Not just a demo - a usable daily chat companion

### Key Features (MVP)
1. **On-Device AI Chat** - Talk to AI models running locally
2. **Multiple Models** - Switch between different AI personalities/models
3. **Conversation History** - Save and revisit past chats
4. **Custom Settings** - Adjust creativity, response length, etc.
5. **Export/Share** - Save conversations as text or markdown

### What Makes It Cool
- **Zero Latency:** Responses start appearing instantly
- **Offline Mode:** Works in airplane mode
- **Battery Efficient:** Uses iPhone 17's dedicated AI chip
- **Privacy:** Your data never leaves your phone

### Your Role
- **Product Owner:** Define features and priorities
- **Tester:** Try builds and provide feedback
- **Model Curator:** Help select/test different Core ML models
- **UX Designer:** Suggest interface improvements

### Development Timeline
**Week 1:** Basic chat interface with dummy responses  
**Week 2:** Core ML integration, real AI responses  
**Week 3:** Settings, history, polish  
**Week 4:** Testing and App Store prep (if desired)

### Tech Stack (Simple Version)
- **Language:** Swift (Apple's programming language)
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (modern Apple UI)

### Success Looks Like
- You can have natural conversations with AI
- App feels as smooth as iMessage
- Friends say "wow, this runs on my phone?"
- Battery lasts all day even with heavy use

### Getting Started
1. Claude will set up the Xcode project
2. You'll test on your iPhone 17
3. We iterate based on what feels right
4. Ship to TestFlight for friends to try

### Questions to Consider
- What kind of AI personality do you want?
- Should it have multiple chat rooms/contexts?
- Want to add voice input/output later?
- Share publicly or keep personal?
